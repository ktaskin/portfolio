## Work Experience
**United States Postal Service, Business Solutions Network Modeling (HQ)** <br />
**Principal Data Analyst (_2023 - Present_)** <br />
**Sr. Operations Research Analyst (_2020 - 2023_)**
- Designed new product offering like Ground Advantage and USPS Connect to provide reliable national and regional shipping service to retail and business customers.
- Developed facility allocation model to assign fulfillment of COVID test kits across 46 fulfillment centers and 143 distribution centers based on distance, demand forecast, employee availability etc. The fulfillment network set up based on the model ensured timely fulfillment and delivery of 270 million COVID test kits across United States with 1.2 average days to deliver
- Built an analytics and visualization tool to provide customers with optimized mixed entry solutions based on entry locations, volume profile & workshare discounts. The tool helped secure service agreements with large volume shippers like DHL, UPS for $5 Billion yearly revenue.
- Utilized market research and historical volume data to forecast package volume growth and sorting capacity needs across USPS facilities. The model was used to create an investment plan of $1.3 Billion to upgrade USPS network for growing package volumes.
